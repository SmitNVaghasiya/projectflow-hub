-- SAM Plan:
    -- we add feature such that site will be able to see the git repo commits in the site in seperate dashboard like view in the site and also the tasks in the site will be updated according to the commits in the git repo.
        -- Now here is my plan we add ai agent such that it will not change any of the written text we did but it will be able to update us by the git repo commits i can put this in seperate section or i can add it such that it will ask user if what agent is updating is correct or not and he will be able to decide to update or not.
        -- we add feature such that site will be able to see the git repo commits in the site in seperate dashboard like view in the site and also the tasks in the site will be updated according to the commits in the git repo.

<!-- -- I have to change database to the postgresql as sql lite is tempory place holder. -- Done.

-- In each delete buttons i have to add feature where i have to type or copy paste project name just as shown in the dialog box so that i or any other user will not accidentally delete the project. -- Priority. -- Done.

-- Have to tell Antigravity to check ui for each scenario as when i click collapse menu button dashboar and settings are not up too the mark in ui and also logout and change theme buttons must be in proper position according to the screen size and collapse menu ui. -- Priority. --> currently gave this task to antigravity to check and fix it. But i have to check if it is fixed or not. -- Done. But there i still have to do somechanges.
        
        -- It even make the side navabar even worst as now it is not able to open and show page on side and when collapsing i can't see any of the button logos.
         

-- Have to tell Antigravity to make the site mobile friendly for me and my friends phone or majority of phones can use so that we can easliy track through the phone. -- Priority.

--- Also have to add feature to make site downloaded apps looks like in the phone or i can say just like the gemini shown in the android phone. it feels like a app and not a website. and easy to use if i can be able to add icon in mobile so not have to search every time think and reseach about it properly.


-- If possible want to add ai agent which will be able to give summrized answers if i asked what tasks pending like this general questions. 
    -- But this is later stage task.       

-- Currently whatever is created is great but i think that all the things just been created feels like it is not proper as i can add what project i added in here but i cannot track the process or add all things i wanted in there i think i needed to connect this with the notion so that i can be able to track this propely and also there i can be able to add whatever i want.
    -- I think there must be some agent or process which will connect this two seamlessly such that if  i add project in here it will must reflect in notion and also if project is completed in the notion it must show this in the our site.
    <!-- Or i can just add feature so that i can add tasks and other things in the site itself and it will be saved just like the notion saves and i can be able to track this propely and also there i can be able to add whatever i want and there will be no complecated process just like the notion and this will be easy to use process?? -->
    -- I have think about above task and have to make sure that which one will be going to be easier so that it will not make my work much more complecated than it should be. --- Discuss with the SAM.


-- I can add something like achieving something badge whenever i add project or task in the site and it will be completed in the dadeline i added and keep track of it just like game for just fun. -- Add later 



<!-- 
-- i wanted to make it such that i can be able to share the link of the project with others and they can be able to see the project and tasks in the site and also they can be able to add tasks and comments in the site. 
    -- But they should not be able to edit or delete any of the tasks or projects.
    -- OR we can add just feature to see the feature. -->

-- There is need for the proper Gmail integration as there is no proper verification of the gmail to check if the mail is valid or not.

-- hey here is the thing first of all can you analyse the  code one more time and see is there any issues in the code or not  as there might be issues in the login and sign up and also the project creation i think it is might not be working so can you check and tell me where you think there is no issues??




Agent cannot view files that are not in the allowlist what is this in the not allowed as in the settings tab currently there is only dummy data so you must be able to do tasks and check each and every services of the project. 
i got above error earlier and so i want you to run the site in browser and test all the buttons and links inside and check if they are working or not first of all ok. 




 

---- now here is thing 
    -- OTP feature
    -- Make the site live
    -- Add the main 20 projects first and than add the remaining projects also inside of the this account ok.
